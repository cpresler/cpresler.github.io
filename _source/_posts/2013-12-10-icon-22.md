Today I had a great time looking at completely adorable elephant pictures! I must say that if you’ve never seen a baby elephant they are absolutely cute, and seem to get caught on camera in the most ridiculous poses! Anyhow all of that “research” was for today’s elephant icon. I didn’t base the icon off one of the super cute pictures, but they were good inspiration. All I can say is that I have a new appreciation for elephants.
