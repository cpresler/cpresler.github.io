This origami fish was fun! The origami artist who formed this creation did a really good job with the face of the fish. The open mouth and shaped eye were all in the original origami fish form. The eye gives the origami fish a lot of character so I made sure to include it in my icon. I also liked how the paper folds felt a little bit like fish scales on the side of the form, so I did my best to include those without flattening the form of the fish too much.
