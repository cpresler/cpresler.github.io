While researching origami animals I came across several different origami horses. They each had different takes on how to form an effective mane and tail. I chose this one over a more elaborate one because I liked the simplicity of the mane. In my opinion the form of the mane is both a simplified shape of a  real horseâ€™s mane and very much a paper shape at the same time. It was fun to try and show that in my origami horse icon. I did opt for a tail from a more complicated origami horse model. I always make forming an effective final image a priority over being accurate to the original inspiration.
