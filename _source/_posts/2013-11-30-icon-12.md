I have a much greater appreciation and respect for frogs since hiking the trail. We were always seeing them when we didn’t expect to. Although it was hard to get them to stick around long enough to take pictures. Frogs are much more skittery than toads, in my experience. They must have less trust in their camouflage.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="" />
    </div>
</div>

It was super tempting to include some of the frog’s beautiful skin patterning in this frog icon, but it would have gotten way to complicated, and probably take on too much specificity for an icon anyhow.
