I was thinking about animals with cool tails yesterday while working on my raccoon icon and realized that beavers have pretty awesome tails. So today’s icon is a beaver icon. I didn’t realize how suave a beaver would look in black and white until I was done, but he’s pretty sophisticated looking. Maybe I should have given him a bow tie?
