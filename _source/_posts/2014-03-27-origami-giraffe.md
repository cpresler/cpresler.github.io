This icon was really fun to make. I’ve become rather fond of giraffe forms, and the simplified paper form of this origami giraffe was really nice. One of the nice thing about origami forms is that they tend to simplify the animal’s form and characteristics down to the very basic. I enjoyed getting to focus on the form over the characteristic skin patterning in this origami giraffe icon. In my other icon set the animal shape took second stage to the giraffe’s skin pattern. This origami giraffe is a fun celebration of the giraffe’s long neck and surprisingly balanced legs.
