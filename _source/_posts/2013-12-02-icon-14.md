Making my frog the other day I wondered how a toad icon would be different so I gave it a shot. It was pretty tricky to make it feel like a toad and not just a poorly drawn frog. The bumpier nature of a toadâ€™s skin is much more complicated to portray in silhouette, but I think I did all right capturing it here.
