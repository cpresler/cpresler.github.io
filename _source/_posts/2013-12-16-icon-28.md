Only a few more icons and I’ll have completed my month of icons. Today’s icon is a whale icon. This one was tricky because whales are so huge, that depicting them with any level of detail on a very small scale is complicated. Though my first original design didn’t scale as well as I liked, I did manage to help it with a few modifications specifically with scale in mind. The end result is something close to a whale silhouette with a few highlighted details.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="whale icon" />
    </div>
