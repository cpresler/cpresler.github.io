I was looking for a slightly quicker animal to do today, and in looking at my list decided on a rhinoceros over a moose. Three horns vs. multi-pronged antlers. That was a simple decision. Still I enjoyed this guyâ€™s sturdy legs and formidable horns. I suppose he is rather in sync with the elephant I did yesterday, although a rhinoceros has much simpler features than an elephant. So here is my rhinoceros icon:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="rhinoceros icon" />
    </div>
</div>

Now back to the rest of my work!
