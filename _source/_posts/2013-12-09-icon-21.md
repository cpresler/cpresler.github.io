After yesterdayâ€™s cat icon, I figured I should take on a dog. As with cats there are tons of different kinds, so I was a little more specific with this one and picked to model my dog icon off of a Malamute which is a breed similar to a husky. I picked them in part because they are great dogs and in part because of their interesting black and white coloring.
