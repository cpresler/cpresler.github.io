I considered having my business cards professionally print, but decided instead to print them myself. On card stock by the French Paper Company I had left from an old project. I printed them on my trusty Epson Inkjet and trimmed the edges. Getting the prints to line up on both sides was the toughest part. Though that was mostly done in the layout in Illustrator.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}2013/11/business-cards-printouts.jpg" alt="Cutting Sheets of Printed Business Cards" />
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}2013/11/business-cards-backfront.jpg" alt="Front and back of my new business cards"/> 
    </div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}2013/11/business-cards2.jpg" alt="fanned stack of business cards"/>
    </div>
</div>

I was going to tint the edges with red, but decided to leave them. Maybe my next set. =)
