So I realize that rats and mice are very similar in some respects and that I have already made an [origami mouse](http://localhost:4000/blog/2014/origami-mouse/) 
icon, but then I came across this really great origami rat. It had way to much fun character to pass up, so here is my depiction of it:

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="origami rat icon" />
    </div>
</div>

I tried to keep the rat’s slightly sinister air, in addition to some of the really soft folds that made up parts of his body like his ears. The paper edge running across the origami rat’s face seemed to add to his character, though it does give him a slightly pirate-ish appearance.
