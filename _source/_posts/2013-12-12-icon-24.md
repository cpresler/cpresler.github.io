I was looking for a simple icon to take on today, so logically I chose today to take on an eight tentacled creature. Still despite not being the simple icon I was wishing to do, I had a good time with this octopus icon. The tentacles definitely were a challenge, but in the end I was reasonably happy with the result.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="octopus icon" />
    </div>
</div>
