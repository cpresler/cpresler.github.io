 I hadn’t given much thought to how flexible giraffes have to be until I did some image research for this giraffe icon. It is impressive to see a giraffe drink from water that is by their toes. It sure is a long way to the ground from way up there!

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="" />
    </div>
</div>

This icon was definitely the toughest yet. With the giraffe’s spots being so key to its “giraffe-ness” I needed to figure out how to include them without making the figure too complicated. It is still more complex than most of my other icons so far, but I guess giraffes are just complicated creatures.
