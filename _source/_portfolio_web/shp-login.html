description: "I collaborated with a Backend Developer to redesign and consolidate Swanson Health Product's account 
creation and login process. I took what had been a multi-page complicated gateway and consolidated it into a single 
multi-use page that is both easier to use and simpler to maintain."

    <p>In redesigning the login section of the page I focused on making the form as simple to use on mobile as 
        possible. Making the login process simple helped encourage user login.</p>

    <p>Simplifying the account creation process was a key part of this project. Aiding in the simplification process
    was instant form validation of all data inputs, particularly passwords. Validating passwords as they are entered 
        helps the user create a compliant password, while encouraging them by tracking their progress.</p>
