I admit the image I had in my head of a cartoon hippo didn’t help me much here. Hippos are big and probably pretty scary in real life. I wouldn’t want to be anywhere near that mouth in real life!

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="" />
    </div>
</div>

The hippo I based this guy on had some serious attitude, which sort of seemed to fit my understanding of hippos in general. I tried to pass that attitude on to this hippo icon, though it was tricky to get the hulking hippo form right with flat black and white shapes.
