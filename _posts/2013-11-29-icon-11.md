Guess I was feeling a little nutty after Thanksgiving, and what is more adorable than a squirrel in icon form? Ok, so in reality lots of things, but Iâ€™d still say that as icons go, squirrels are reasonably cute.    

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="" />
    </div>
</div>

A squirrel icon turned out to be more complicated than I thought. Getting that classic squirrel pose to have good definition as a mostly silhouette form was tricky. The classic icon balance between enough information and too much.
