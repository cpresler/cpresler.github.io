Yeah, so the mane of this origami lion totally blew me away. Whoever designed this beautiful origami piece has some serious skills. The waves a curves of the lionâ€™s mane were just really nice. I tried my best to capture some of style that made the origami lion so picturesque in my origami lion icon. It gave me some neat chances to play with light and dark shapes created by the layering of the paper.
