There is nothing like a little monkeying around to start your day! I wasnâ€™t sure how to take on a monkey. There are so many cartoony images of monkeys around, but I wanted to create an icon a little closer to the real thing. So here is my attempt at a monkey icon:   

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="monkey icon" />
    </div>
</div>
