Yup I saved a fish for the last days of this exercise. After all what could possibly beat an octopus anyway? Actually this fish icon came from some cool koi images I have seen recently and been inspired by. Therefore while this went up onto the noun project website as a generic fish icon, it is actually a koi icon.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="fish icon" />
    </div>
</div>
