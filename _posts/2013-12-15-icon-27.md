Taking on a lion was a lot of fun, though trickier than I expected. It was difficult to depict both the shape of the figure and the iconic shape of the mane using solid black, but I think it works fairly well. My favorite part of this lion icon is the face, though I think Iâ€™d rather enjoy lion faces from afar or in photograph. Lions are some seriously large cats!
