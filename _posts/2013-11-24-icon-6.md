Seeing as how Iâ€™m currently residing in North Dakota, it seemed only fair that I should work a buffalo icon into my icon series.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3">
        <img src="{{ site.blog_img_url | prepend: site.url }}{{page.feat_img}}" alt="buffalo icon" />
    </div>
</div>

Also, I just learned that what most Americans call buffalo are technically bison. So I guess this is actually a bison icon
