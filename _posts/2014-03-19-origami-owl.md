As it turns out origami owls are tricky to depict. Trying to get the eyes and body of the owl to show the way it does in the folded paper owl doesnâ€™t really work. Simply depicting the forms makes it look more like a patterned object than a real owl. I think that part of it is that origami owls are a bit more simplified than some other folded paper creatures, and are thus more abstracted. The more abstracted an object I start with, the trickier it is to come up with a depiction that is able to really stand in the for the object as an icon. That is some of the difficulty and fun of this series of icons.
