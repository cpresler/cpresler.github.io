Wow, I can’t believe I’m already up to twenty with these! This turned into an animal project unintentionally, but I’ve been enjoying exploring different animals. Though after a few days of more unusual animals I decided to go back to an old favorite. I enjoy cats a lot and it was fun to create this elegant black and white gentleman. There were lots of cat icons on The Noun Project already, but none that used black and white in this way, so I thought I’d give it a go. He’s got that tuxedo look to him, but that’s ok with me!
