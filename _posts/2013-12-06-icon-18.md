One of the tough things about making a turtle icon for me was picking a particular turtle. Originally I was thinking of a box turtle because we saw so many of them in the wild this summer, but when I looked around I couldn’t help but find the shell patterns of several other turtles a little bit more fun to depict. I had fun “tiling” his shell.
