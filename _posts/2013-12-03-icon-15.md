I saw a movie preview for a documentary about the lemurs of Madascar recently and I couldnâ€™t help thinking about how much fun it would be to make a lemur icon. There are many different types of lemurs, but ring tailed lemurs are by far the most well known, so they were the obvious pick for an icon. Lemurs are very playful and gracefully acrobatic creatures so I tried to keep that in mind when making this icon
