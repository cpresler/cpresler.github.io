I found several origami hummingbirds in my research, and while the particular origami hummingbird this icon is primarily based off of was not the most intricately or expertly folded, it did have the most striking lines. I think my fascination with the strong shapes of the paper form came through in my graphical representation of this origami hummingbird. The strong shapes in this make me think it might find its way into some logo work in the future, for the right company of course.
