Iâ€™m starting an icon a day challenge inspired by [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com){: target="_blank" }. The goal is one per day for a month, finishing up December 19th. Icons are uniquely challenging because they need to be vague enough to convey the meaning of a category and specific enough to refer to only one category. Or at least that is how I think about them. My first icon actually turned into two because it worked both as a silhouette and a line drawing.
