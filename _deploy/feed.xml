        <title>Origami Fish Icon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This origami fish was fun! The origami artist who formed this creation did a really good job with the face of the fish. The open mouth and shaped eye were all in the original origami fish form. The eye gives the origami fish a lot of character so I made sure to include it in my icon. I also liked how the paper folds felt a little bit like fish scales on the side of the form, so I did my best to include those without flattening the form of the fish too much.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Origami Giraffe Icon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This icon was really fun to make. I’ve become rather fond of giraffe forms, and the simplified paper form of this origami giraffe was really nice. One of the nice thing about origami forms is that they tend to simplify the animal’s form and characteristics down to the very basic. I enjoyed getting to focus on the form over the characteristic skin patterning in this origami giraffe icon. In my other icon set the animal shape took second stage to the giraffe’s skin pattern. This origami giraffe is a fun celebration of the giraffe’s long neck and surprisingly balanced legs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Origami Hummingbird Icon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found several origami hummingbirds in my research, and while the particular origami hummingbird this icon is primarily based off of was not the most intricately or expertly folded, it did have the most striking lines. I think my fascination with the strong shapes of the paper form came through in my graphical representation of this origami hummingbird. The strong shapes in this make me think it might find its way into some logo work in the future, for the right company of course.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Origami Horse Icon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While researching origami animals I came across several different origami horses. They each had different takes on how to form an effective mane and tail. I chose this one over a more elaborate one because I liked the simplicity of the mane. In my opinion the form of the mane is both a simplified shape of a  real horse’s mane and very much a paper shape at the same time. It was fun to try and show that in my origami horse icon. I did opt for a tail from a more complicated origami horse model. I always make forming an effective final image a priority over being accurate to the original inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Origami Bat Icon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I found the origami bat really interesting because it had never occurred to me to try and fold a bat out of paper. I found the bat’s wings particularly intriguing. The folds necessary to create the form make create an attractive geometric pattern that I wanted to keep in my icon of the origami bat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Origami Swan Icon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This origami swan was really elegant, and I tried to keep some of that elegance in the icon. It has a beautiful flow to the form and the swan itself hardly looks made of paper except in the wings. It was fun to put this origami swan together as a black and white icon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Origami Lion Icon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so the mane of this origami lion totally blew me away. Whoever designed this beautiful origami piece has some serious skills. The waves a curves of the lion’s mane were just really nice. I tried my best to capture some of style that made the origami lion so picturesque in my origami lion icon. It gave me some neat chances to play with light and dark shapes created by the layering of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Origami Owl Icon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As it turns out origami owls are tricky to depict. Trying to get the eyes and body of the owl to show the way it does in the folded paper owl doesn’t really work. Simply depicting the forms makes it look more like a patterned object than a real owl. I think that part of it is that origami owls are a bit more simplified than some other folded paper creatures, and are thus more abstracted. The more abstracted an object I start with, the trickier it is to come up with a depiction that is able to really stand in the for the object as an icon. That is some of the difficulty and fun of this series of icons.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Origami Butterfly Icon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This origami butterfly icon was based on an incredible folded paper creation the size of a person’s hand. I think it may have been folded from a large sheet of tissue paper. I found the folding pattern on the butterfly’s wings to be particularly elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Origami Rat Icon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I realize that rats and mice are very similar in some respects and that I have already made an &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/blog/2014/origami-mouse/&quot;&gt;origami mouse&lt;/a&gt; 
icon, but then I came across this really great origami rat. It had way to much fun character to pass up, so here is my depiction of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;http://christypresler.com/assets/images/blog/2014/03/origami-rat-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;origami rat icon&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to keep the rat’s slightly sinister air, in addition to some of the really soft folds that made up parts of his body like his ears. The paper edge running across the origami rat’s face seemed to add to his character, though it does give him a slightly pirate-ish appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
