        <p>The custom WordPress plugin uses OAuth to allow for social login, as well as single sign-in with PBS apps. Allowing a WCNY Member to login to our website to access a wide variety of PBS content.</p>
        <p>The plugin also allows for one-time user account activation which aligns the user's digital account with their WCNY membership. The activation page includes the ability to receive activation codes as parameters, enabling auto activation of members who respond to links withing e-communications.</p>

        <p>Once the user has activated, and logged in, using one of the available options, I incorporated an authenticated check throughout the site. Currently it is being used to direct a user to login, or visit the membersite, but it is built to allow WCNY to expand content for authenticated members across the site in future projects.</p>
        <p>The MemberSite itself incorporates video, streaming radio, account information, and a variety of member-exclusive resources.</p>
