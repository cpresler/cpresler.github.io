<div class="details col-lg-6">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/projects/bogo/sale-products.jpg" alt="Different Products on Sale Pages"/>
    <p>I consolidated multiple product includes into one standard product include for sale pages, and created dynamic elements for the page specific elements on each product.</p>

<div class="details col-lg-6">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/projects/dod/dod-clock.jpg" alt="Deal of the Day Countdown Clock"/>
    <p>I reformatted the pages so that they function properly on mobile. I redesigned previously static elements, like this countdown clock so that it flexes to fit across all devices.</p>
