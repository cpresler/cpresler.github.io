    <p>I used JSP to dynamically pull in the top four items in each sale for easy viewing by the customer.</p>

<div class="details col-lg-6">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/projects/web-specials/ws-nav.jpg" alt="Web Specials Sub Nav"/>
    <p>To make the page easier to navigate I created a custom sub-navigation that allows users to jump to the sale of their choice.</p>
